# template-flask-REST
Template REST flask application that can be run using Docker.

This provides a basic template which can be expanded upon to create a fully fledged REST Flask application that is
production ready.


## Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to:
   - Reduce time required for setting up a REST Flask application for future projects.
   - Give an easy to update template that can be improved upon benefiting older and newer projects.
   
## Future plans and additions:
#### Database:
  - Debating whether or not to add `flask_sqlalchemy` to the project as it is almost a requisite, at least personally,
  for all of my Flask projects.
  

## Installed packages:
I have installed a selection of packages and I shall link all of their homepages to make it easier to browse specific
configurations. Most of these applications will be pre-configured by default in this project, but the links are there
for deeper customisation that fits your specific projects needs and wants.
